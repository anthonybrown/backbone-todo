# Backbone todo

This is my first todo app with backbone.
I made one a long time ago with PHP and jQuery
This is my take on a todo app with all the logic on the client

I still need to add more functionality and add persistence,
~~validate the main todo input field.~~ I have validation on the
list once the todo is made, for example, if I try and edit a task
and try and leave it blank or with spaces, it will not update. I will
add the same for the main input.
